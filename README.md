## Agenda and organisation <a name="agenda" />
For this hands-on session of Gammapy, we will experience a new format within this 2h slot.
The session will be made with two parts:
- one for learners or beginners
- one for more advanced users

After having given the instructions to the more advanced users, we will start with the learner part. Then,
we will work with the advanced users, making our best to continue to help the beginners.

In this context, we **ask to register yourself** (in the [Participant list](#participant) section) in order
to help us to adjust the content of each part.


## Installation and set-up<a name="install" />
